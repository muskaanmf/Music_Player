# Music_Player

This Music Player is built in Android Studio
By using two activities - activity_main.xml and
                          activity_play_song.xml
                          
In the AndroidManifest.xml file add the user permission right after the <manifest> tag and put it as 
 < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

In the build gradle module file 
add the third-party dependencies as
implementation 'com.karumi:dexter:6.2.3'   --> copy paste this in the dependencies section

Futher more features can be added as your wish
Hope this might be helpful to you
Thank You :):
